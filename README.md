# Dotfiles

These are configs I like for programs I use often. Feel free to contribute!

## How to Install

```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/akenn/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

# change directory to the newly cloned repo
cd ~/.dotfiles

# install everything!
sh install.sh
```

**Note:** running `sh install.sh` is just a glorified `cp` and isn't mandatory.
Feel free do dig into each section of these configs and rip out what you want.
