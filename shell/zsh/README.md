# Zsh Configs

A large portion of the code in this folder was ripped out of [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Contents:

- **lib/**: part of [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- **plugins/**: plugins I liked from [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- **themes/**: I theme I made (andrewk.zsh-theme) and one I liked ([pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)) 
- **oh-my-zsh.sh**: slightly modified init script for oh-my-zsh.
- **zshrc.symlink**: my zsh settings
